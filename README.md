# I want to develop land and property - index

Pages, primarily for a design audience, to:

* introduce the service/project/phase
* link to the prototype(s) - behind accounts
* link to other sources of useful information - behind accounts

## User need

As a designer joining the project/service team i need to get up to speed with:

* context - why are we doing what we are doing now
* where is all the stuff i need to be immediately productive
* all the other stuff i may need, a bit less urgently than right now

## Principles of this repo/pages

* be public by default, only protect information when necessary (marking when information is behind an account, who is allowed, and how to get access)
* provide a means of contact
